    "summary": "I'm born in Trondheim, Norway. I lived my first 18 years in Stadsbygd, Norway. After high school I spent a year in Bodø, Norway in the Norwegian Air Force as a soldier. After one year in the military I moved to Trondheim and started on NTNU where I studied Information Technology. Ever since I was a kid I’ve been watching and playing football. I’ve been a huge fan of Premier League and especially Chelsea all those years. Creating IT solutions for my own amateur football team got me into Sportradar in Trondheim. I wrote my bachelor thesis for Sportradar where I made a server-side rendered Livescore solution that is in production today. It was based on technologies like Webpack, Node, React and Redux. After I graduated from NTNU I started working as a full time employee for Sportradar in Trondheim.",
